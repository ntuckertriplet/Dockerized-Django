<h1>W2 Information</h1>
<h3>Attention Employees</h3>
<p>Hello, it's the Intern!</p>

<p>I'm excited to be here! I'm posting this message as a reminder that we will be
    getting your W2 forms handed back to you in the store this week! As I'm an intern and 
    I don't know who all of you are, please make it simple and do the following on Friday:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Wear our employee T-shirt so I can easily find you</li>
    <li>Let me know if you're picking up more than one W2 form in advance</li>
    <li>Let us know if you'd rather have this mailed to you instead</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, and have a great rest of your day!!! :)</p>
